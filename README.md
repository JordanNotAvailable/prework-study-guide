# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to help store infomation and notes for boot camp students going through the precourse work to assist in the overload of new information.
Its contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript and allowed me to not only learn the basics of each of these topics/languages but through repetative actions helped ingrain the knowledge.
