          <li>The head element contains informartion about the webpage allowing the broswer to render the page correctly</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visual content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The elements included in the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage</li>
          <li>HTML elements are case sensitive</li>
          <li>h1-h6 must be used in order to help those using screen readers and h1 should only be used once per page</li>
          <li>Alt text for images is important to not only assist those using screen readers but it also improves your SEO</li>
          <li>The better your SEO (Search Engine Optimization) the more frequently your page will turn up in searches</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>
          
         <li>Enter your CSS notes here</li>

         <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
         <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
         <li>CSS RULES example - div {color:blue; text-align:justify;}</li>
         <li>Selector is at the start of the code (div) and defines the elements or attributes to which the rules or decloratons will apply</li>
         <li>Declorations contains two important components: the CSS property we want to apply (color) and the value of the property (blue)</li>
         <li>Do not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code inorder to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained,
             DRY can greatly reduce the over all size and complesxity of the codebase</li>
         <li>The value of the property can be chosen from grey to blue and a hex# can also be used</li>

         <li>git must start every Git statement</li>
         <li>git status - checks what branch we are working on</li>
         <li>git checkout -b branch-name - creates a new brance and switches to it</li>
         <li>git revert - goes to previous version</li>
         <li>git add -A - commits all files to working branch</li>
         <li>git commit -m "description of change" - updates git repo with the working directory</li>
         <li>git pull origin main - syncs the local branch wiht the remote branch in GitHub</li>
         <li>git push origin "branch name" pushes changes made to GItHub to be merged</li>
         <li>The defult branch in called main/master and all work should be done on a working/feature branch 
             and once reviewed and tested can be merged to main branch</li>
         <li>A feature branch can hold the code for a single feature where a development branch 
             can hold the code for multiple feature branches waiting to be merged</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>

         <li>Enter your JavaScript notes here</li>
         <li>JavaScript is case sensitive</li>
         <li>To declare a variable you use the keyword var an after the keyword you give the variable a name</li>
         <li>The name must be unique as it will referance all the code stored inside the variable</li>
         <li>you then use an operater (=) to assign the specific data you want stored in the variable</li>
         <li>E.G. var topics = "HTML", CSS, Git, JavaScript"; - topics is the variable name and all after the operator is the data stored in the variable</li>
         <li>Each line of JavaScript ends in a semicolon (;)</li>
         <li>All strings are surrounded by quotaion marks (")</li>
         <li>The style.css file gets linked with the head element and the script.js gets linked with the body</li>
         <li>Control flow is the order in which the computer executes code in a script</li>
         <li>The order of code matters - you cant have console.log(topics) before you define what the varible topics is</li>
         <li>(===) is the strictly equality operater and it checks to see if two values are equal and returns with a true result if they are equal and a false result if they are not</li>
         <li>True and False are both Boolean values</li>
         <li>An array is a single variable used to hold a group of data</li>
         <li>Arrays are typically used to store data that is in some way related</li>
         <li>E.G. var shape = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</li>
         <li>Arrays can be a custer of different data such as strings, numbers and Boolean values</li>
         <li>E.G. var studentInfo = ["Lu", 54, true]; - this shows the students name, age and if they are enrolled, Lu is in quotation marks because it is a string, 54 is a number and true is a Boolean so they dont need quotation marks</li>
         <li>Array Index allows you to access a singhle piece of data within an array</li>
         <li>The first item in an array is 0 and continues sequentially in only whole numbers</li>
         <li>Instead of writing out 1,000 lines of code to get all the numbers for each bit of data inside the array you can use a 'for' loop</li>
         <li>E.G. for (var x=0; x shapes.length; x++) - var x=0 is declaring x is equal to 0 - x shapes.length because x is less then the numvber of shapes (4) the loop will keep running 
             - x++ now everytime the loop repeats it will increase by one until the end of the array and then the loop will stop</li>
         <li>Functions are a reusable block of code that preforms a specific task with the instructions given</li>
         <li>To create a function you use the key word 'function' then followed by a unique name as you will use this name everytime you call the function</li>
         <li>A function name is always followed by parenteses ()</li>
         <li>Control + Shift + i pulls up the Google Chrome DevTools</li>
         <li>You can quickly test out JavaScript code in Chrome DevTools</li>
